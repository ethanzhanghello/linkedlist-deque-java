## 🏷️ Project Title

**LinkedListDeque – Java Implementation**  
A generic, doubly-linked list–based double-ended queue supporting constant-time operations at both ends.

---

## 📖 Project Description

This project is a custom Java implementation of a double-ended queue (deque) using a doubly linked list. It provides constant-time performance for adding and removing elements at either end, and supports generics for broad usability. Designed with clean modular structure and abstraction through interfaces, it’s ideal for learning and interviews.

---

## 💻 Technologies Used

- Java 8+
- Java Generics
- Java Interfaces
- Java Collection fundamentals

---

## 📋 Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Java-compatible IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)
- Familiarity with compiling and running `.java` files

---

## ⚙️ Installation Instructions

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/linkedlistdeque-java.git
cd linkedlistdeque-java
```

Open the project in your IDE and compile `LinkedListDeque61B.java`.  
Ensure all files are in the same package or adjust package declarations.

---

## 🕹️ Usage Instructions

```java
LinkedListDeque<String> deque = new LinkedListDeque<>();
deque.addFirst("CS");
deque.addLast("61B");
System.out.println(deque.removeFirst()); // CS
System.out.println(deque.removeLast());  // 61B
```

Try combining this with test cases to explore behavior and performance.

---

## 📚 Documentation

- `Deque61B.java` – Interface defining the deque API
- `LinkedListDeque61B.java` – Core doubly-linked deque implementation
- `Maximizer61B.java` – Example utility class for testing max values in deques

JavaDocs are included inline to assist with method expectations and behaviors.

---

## 🖼️ Visuals

*(Add a diagram showing the internal structure of the deque with sentinel nodes and example operations)*

## 🛟 Support Information

For questions or bugs:
- Open an issue via GitHub
- Or contact via email: `your-email@example.com`

---

## 🗺️ Project Roadmap

- ✅ Implemented basic operations: `addFirst`, `addLast`, `removeFirst`, `removeLast`
- ✅ Included iterative and recursive `get` methods
- 🔄 Add iterator support
- 🔜 Benchmarking and JUnit test suite

---

## 📈 Project Status

**Completed**  
Fully functional and tested. May be expanded with iterator and benchmarking tools.
